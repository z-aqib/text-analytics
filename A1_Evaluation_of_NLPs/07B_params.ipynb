X\n\nCher Dr. Ustaad,\nJ'espère que cette lettre vous trouve bien. Je vous écris pour exprimer mes préoccupations concernant le comportement de M. X lors de la classe d'Introduction à la zoologie l'an dernier. De nombreuses fois, M. X a fait des remarques moqueuses sur les questions des étudiants et n'a pas fourni une feedback claire sur les devoirs.\nDe plus, la notation semblait inégale et injuste, sans possibilité de clarification ou de recours.\nJe trouve cette expérience profondément frustrante et démotivante, et je crois qu'elle a affecté ma performance dans le cours. J'apprécierais que la département examine ce sujet et assure un environnement de formation plus positif et soutenu pour les futurs étudiants.\nMerci de votre attention à ce sujet.\nSincèrement,\nShaagird\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-02T11:37:22.567387Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-02T11:37:22.567703Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-02T11:37:22.571338Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-02T11:37:22.567653Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-02T11:37:22.570464Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# start the timer\nstart_time = time.time()\n\n# generate the output\n# messages = [\n#     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt_back_to_eng}\n# ]\noutput = generator(prompt_back_to_eng)\n\n# end the timer\nend_time = time.time()\n\n# display time taken with output\nprint(compute_time(start_time, end_time))\nprint(\"Output:\\n\", output[0][\"generated_text\"])#textwrap.fill(output[0][\"generated_text\"], width=80))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-02T11:37:22.572198Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-02T11:37:22.572486Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-02T11:44:49.116298Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-02T11:37:22.572457Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-02T11:44:49.115319Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:11 for open-end generation.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"Time taken: 0h 7m 26s 530ms\nOutput:\n \nTexte traduit en anglais :\nDear Dr. Ustaad,\nI hope this letter finds you well.
