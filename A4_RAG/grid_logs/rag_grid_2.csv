solution to one subproblem overlaps with the solution to another subproblem, and
both solutions can be computed recursively. Examples of subproblems that can
overlap include finding the maximum element in a list, finding the smallest
element in a list, finding the sum of all elements in a list, or finding the
product of all elements in a list. The overlap is achieved by using the
solutions from the previous subproblem to reduce the size of the current
subproblem.  In this lecture, we will study several examples of subproblems that
can overlap using dynamic programming. These problems are not only useful for
solving combinatorial problems, but they can also be applied in other domains
such as cryptography, machine learning, and computer vision.  Objective: Study
the fundamental ideas of Dynamic Programming, including the concept of
