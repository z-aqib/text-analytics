## Assignment 1 - Evaluation of NLPs
In this assignment for Introduction to Text Analytics, I evaluated three LLMs — Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, open-thoughts/OpenThinker-7B, and microsoft/phi-4 — across tasks like summarization, question answering, keyword extraction, and translation. Each model was scored based on conciseness, clarity, accuracy, completeness, fidelity, fluency, and consistency. Qwen (3B) emerged as the best overall model due to its speed, accuracy, and ability to handle all tasks effectively, making it the most suitable for deployment at IBA. OpenThinker (7B) performed best specifically in keyword extraction. Overall, the assignment highlighted the trade-offs between model size, response quality, and processing time.

## Assignment 2 - Evaluation of K-means
In Assignment 02 for Introduction to Text Analytics, the task was to comprehensively evaluate K-Means clustering on text data using a wide range of preprocessing and vectorization combinations. The clustering was tested for three different values of k (5, 9, and 13) across 48 unique setups involving variations in stopword removal, stemming versus lemmatization, unigram versus bigram generation, and vectorization methods like BOW (using TP or TF), TF-IDF, and Truncated SVD with different components (50, 100, 200). Each configuration was assessed based on silhouette score and WSS to determine clustering quality. Results showed that LSA with 50 components consistently outperformed other methods, delivering the best silhouette scores and the lowest WSS values. Additionally, the analysis revealed that bigrams generally improved performance, stopword removal was always beneficial, and lemmatization slightly outperformed stemming. Overall, LSA 50 was found to be the most effective and efficient approach for clustering in this assignment.
